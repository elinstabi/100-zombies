100% zombies

Counts an average of how long it takes for one zombie to infect a village with 100 houses.
When the zombie enters the house and infect it's owner we have two zombies and one red house. 
The two start infecting new owners/houses but have no memory of which houses they already been to.

This goes on until all houses have been infected ten times, then take an avarge of how many times the 
program must run until this happens.
